# Addictus
-A time tracking program
+Do you have a feeling that you might be using the computer too much? Fear not, Addictus is for you. 
+
+Team Addictus strives for bettering lives that are ruined by a computer/internet addiction. Our unique selling proposition is the great delivery of a free Windows tracking programme that has never been seen before. The user experience is far superior to other applications and to top it all off, it looks fantastic.
+
+Our main focus was on making it easier for people to improve their time managment. Addictus enables you to track your PC usage, set goals and look at statistics in form of a fancy pie chart. Your stats are saved locally to your computer and are in no way shape or form used by us. The project is open source, so feel free to add features or contact us if you want to request features. A website for the application, a database with user data, online global statistics or algorithms that recognise addictive behaviour are all things of the future that we might be working on. Applications for other operating systems like linux are unlikely to be released any time soon.
+
+The programme was made in c# with the Windows Presentation Foundation and various libraries such as material design.
